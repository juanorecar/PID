# Digit Recognition


### Code Requirements
You can install Conda for python which resolves all the dependencies for machine learning.

### Description
Softmax Regression (synonyms: Multinomial Logistic, Maximum Entropy Classifier, or just Multi-class Logistic Regression) is a generalization of logistic regression that we can use for multi-class classification (under the assumption that the classes are mutually exclusive). In contrast, we use the (standard) Logistic Regression model in binary classification tasks.

### Python  Implementation

1) Dataset- MNIST dataset
2) Images of size 28 X 28
3) Classify digits from 0 to 9
4) Logistic Regression, Shallow Network and Deep Network Support added.


### Test Acuracy ~ 90 to 98%


### Execution for showing images through webcam
To run the code, type `python Digit-Recognizer.py`

```
python Digit-Recognizer.py
```
